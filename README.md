# React + TypeScript + Vite

Small project that I use to get the jest of React and some of it's most used hooks (mainly useQuery and useContext)
The project is absolutely not serious, it's just a grid of animal pictures and some silly stuff.
Using https://shibe.online/ for the list of images

1. run `npm install` to get all deps
2. run `npm run dev` to start the project
